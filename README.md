# Schedule-Sort

Sorting algorithms are infamous for being difficult to understand and implement, which is why Schedule-Sortâ„¢\* delegates all of this difficult work to Linux's FIFO process scheduler, yielding an O(n) integer sorting algorithm \*\* \*\*\*. The algorithm works by creating a new thread for each integer in the list, and assigning said thread a priority equal to its value. Once all the threads have been created, they are run in order of decreasing priority, with each thread appending its value to the sorted list.

- \* Trademark pending.
- \*\* Assuming the FIFO scheduler is O(n), which I am too lazy to check.
- \*\*\* Only integers in range [1,99] can be sorted.

## Running

This program can only be compiled on Linux, and must be run as root after enabling realtime scheduling: `sysctl -w kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us=-1`.

If the program does not work, you likely did not enable realtime scheduling, but because I do enough error handling at work to be bothered to add it to a gag program, you might have to experiment for yourself.

The compilation and invocation can be performed as follows:
```
$ cc sort.c -o sort -lpthread
# ./sort 1 2 3
```
